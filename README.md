# AWS Capstone-Project
# Project Description
In this project, I had the opportunity to demonstrate my solution design skills.
I applied the architectural design principles in this project to:
- Deploy a PHP application that runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance.
- Create a database instance that the PHP application can query.
- Create a MySQL database from an SQL dump file.
- Update application parameters in an AWS System Manager Parameter Store.
- Secure the application to prevent public access to backend systems.
